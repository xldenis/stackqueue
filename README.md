#StackQ: Know what you don't know

A *Y-Hack 2013* project.

StackQ creates procedural quizzes on any subject by pulling questions on any subject from the Stack Exchange network. Based off of your answers it then learns which subjects you are strongest and weakest at, and continues drilling you on your weak spots to help you improve. Thanks to the size of Stack Exchange nearly any topic can be used as quiz subject,  from movies to history or the Japanese language.
